# slack-bot-room-manager-linkit-7688-duo
This repo contains the code for a 'smart' IoT-enabled Slack bot that manages a room.
The bot monitors the environmental conditions in the room (temp, light, power usage) and the occupancy. It takes commands to book the room via Slack and also via a webapp designed to be displayed on a tablet outside the room.
